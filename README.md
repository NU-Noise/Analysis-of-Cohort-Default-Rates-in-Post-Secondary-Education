**Summary**

On September 25th, 2019, the US Department of Education announced that the national cohort default rate from the 2016 
fiscal year decreased to 10.1% from 10.8% in 2015. (US Department of Education, 2019) 
A decrease in cohort default rate was seen for public, private, and proprietary institutions. 
However, the smallest decrease in default rate was seen in proprietary (private, for-profit) institutions. 
Out of 15 schools that were sanctioned by the US Department of Education due to having a cohort default rate 
higher than 30%, 13 were proprietary colleges. 

We propose that private, for-profit institutions operate more often in areas with larger minority (non-white) 
populations in order to generate larger enrollment figures.
